#  Reactive Downloader Library for Android in Kotlin

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/oussaki/RxKotlinDownloader.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/oussaki/RxKotlinDownloader)
[![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/API-14%2B-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://android-arsenal.com/api?level=14)

This library provides a simple api to download files and handle data stream in a reactive way 
it's completly written in Kotlin Language 

# Usage
	

Example:

```kotlin

// Create one instance 

fun downloader():Unit{
 rxDownloader = RxDownloader
                .Builder(applicationContext)
                .addFile("http://reactivex.io/assets/Rx_Logo_S.png")
                .build();

// Subscribe to start downloading files 
     rxDownloader.asList()
                .subscribe({ files, throwable ->
                    Log.d(TAG, "Just received ${files.size} file")
                    files.forEachIndexed { index, fileContainer ->
                        Log.d(TAG, "File in position: ${index} is ${fileContainer}")
                    }
                });
}

```

# Hanling Progress & Error Events

There is 5 Events you can use in this library:
  
      * `doOnStart` : This event will be called before start downloading files.
      * `doOnProgress` : This event will publish the current progress each time a file downloaded.
      * `doOnEachSingleError` : Event called each time a file failed to download.
      * `doOnCompleteWithError` : Event called when finish all the downloads and some of the files failed to download.
      * `doOnCompleteWithSuccess` : Event called when finish downloading all the files successfully.

* Example:

```kotlin
 RxDownloader
                .Builder(applicationContext)
                .addFile("http://reactivex.io/assets/Rx_Logo_S.png")
                .build()
                .doOnProgress({ progress ->
                    // do something useful here
                })
                .doOnStart({
                    // do something useful here
                })
                .doOnEachSingleError({ e: Throwable ->
                    // do something useful here also:D

                })
                .doOnCompleteWithError({

                })
                .doOnCompleteWithSuccess({

                })
                .asList()
                .subscribe({ files, error ->

                });
```

# Options :

* Customize OkHttpClient  
```kotlin
	 var ok:OkHttpClient = OkHttpClient.Builder().connectTimeout(6,TimeUnit.SECONDS).build();
     RxDownloader
                .Builder(context)
                .client(ok)
                .build();
```
* Customize Directory to save your files
	By default files will be saved in cache directory.
	You can just customize the directory by calling : `storage(File storagePath)`

* Building list of urls methods:

	- `addFile(String url)`: add url directly to list of urls without renaming the downloaded file.
	- `addFile(String newName, String url)`: add url to list and renaming the file to newName, Ps: No need to write the file extension.
	- `addFiles(List<String> urls)`: add a bulk of URL's.



# Download Strategies
  
  	-MAX Strategy: will try to download all the files in case of errors it's will continue till the end.

```kotlin
 	 RxDownloader
                .Builder(context)
                .strategy(DownloadStrategy.MAX)
                

```

    
    -ALL Strategy: will try to download all the files but if it encountered an error it's will stop immediately.

```kotlin
	RxDownloader
                .Builder(context)
                .strategy(DownloadStrategy.ALL)
```

Sometimes you want your files to be in a certain order, for that you can achieve that by calling the `Order` Method in `Builder` this way:

  ```kotlin 
  .Order(DownloadStrategy.FLAG_SEQUENTIAL)
  ```

    * By default the downloader is using `FLAG_PARALLEL` to achieve more speed and performance 


# Setup

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```groovy 
allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```

Add the dependency to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.oussaki:RxKotlinDownloader:0.1'
}
```
